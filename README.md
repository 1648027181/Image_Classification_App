## Overview
This is a simple image classification web application, using both Streamlit and PyTorch.

## Motivation
For people who are not experts at Django or Flask, Streamlit can be a good alternative to build custom Python web apps for data science. I chose image classification here because computer vision is one of the most popular areas of AI currently, powered by deep learning algorithms.

## Procedure
  * Install Streamlit
  * Build UI
  * Build Model
  * Test Results
  * Next Steps
  
## Model
I have chosen the pretrained ResNet101 model to perform classification.
  
## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
